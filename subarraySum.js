// Easy case is when the list is made up of only positive numbers and the maximum sum is the 
//sum of the whole array. If the list is made up of only negative numbers, return 0 instead.
// Empty list is considered to have zero greatest sum. Note that the empty 
//list or array is also a valid sublist/subarray.

//The maximum sum subarray problem consists 
//in finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence in an array or list of integers:
//(maxSequence([]), 0
//maxSequence([-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]), 6
